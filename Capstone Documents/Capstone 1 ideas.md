# Capstone 1 Ideas (Philip Bailey)

## PhilipB[NOV20]

### In Order

**Adopt-a-Pet using petfinder API.**

`(https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/)`
A website to search for pets available for adoption from various participating organizations. A search would return pets meeting criteria and display photos and information about each animal. The user would be able to add the pet to a list of favorites and display the list of animals in the list. The user would have the ability to add comments to the favorite animals and edit /delete the animal as needed. The Petfinder API uses OAuth for secure authentication.

**SpaceX launch information using spaceX API.**

`https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/README.md`

This website would provide information about SpaceX launches both future and past. Information about next and future launches would display at index page opening with the option to search for past launch information including photos and / or videos of launches. The launch information could be added to a user list of launches for recall at a later time. This list would be maintained by the user (add,delete, recall, etc)

**Hubbel Space Telescope images using hubbelsite API.** 

`http://hubblesite.org/api/documentation`
Similar to the SpaceX project, the utility of this project is in the ability to manage telescope image and data in the user favorites list. The number of images, and categories coupled with the current UI makes finding and keeping track of the image just found a daunting task. A method to record / store the images information and then be able to easily retrieve the image / information would make searching and comparing images much easier.
